Here are some useful tools for steganography:

 - tools you already have:

file : identify what kind of file you are working with (useful when file is a binary with no extension)
strings : can be used to extract readable strings from a binary

 - tools you can download:

exiftool : see/edit the metadata of files
steghide : embed/extract files into images

Hello, you successfully got a shell!
You can get the flag int flag.txt, but avoid spoiling yourself the other challenges.

In real world ctf, those challenge will allow you to either get a shell as another user
(when done on a ssh server for example) or they will allow you to get a shell on a remote machine
using something like netcat (`nc`).

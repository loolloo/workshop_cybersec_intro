Chall1 :

Is this ascii upside down?

This file is gibberish, maybe we can look at the bytes and figure out a pattern

useful commands:

xxd :
  `xxd -p` to get the bytes as hex
  `xxd -p -c 100` to get the bytes as hex in one line
  `xxd -p -r` to change the hex back to bytes

hexdump :
  `hexdump -C` to visualize the bytes of a binary file

And another one I won't tell you about ;)



Chall2 :

base(4^3) * (4^2)

This file looks encrypted... What tools could to decrypt it?

Hint : there is a useful command in bash that can reverse this encryption



Chall3 :

Encryption-ception

This one is going to be tough! My sources tell me that a certain roman emperor interfered
with the encrypted message. Thankfully, the encryption behind it is a simpler version of
the one used in the last challenge.

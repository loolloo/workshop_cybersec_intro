To launch the web challenges, you need to have python3 and php installed.

Then you can just launch each challenge using it's shell script

example:
    ./chall1.sh
will launch the first web challenge. If you don't have firefox installed, just
use the url the script gives you in your browser of choice.

The html or php service will run in the background so don't forget to close them when you are done.
That will be done with ./close_server.sh

If you want to play by the rules, don't ever look at the sources in .files/
In real world ctf challenges, you won't have access to the server's local files directly
